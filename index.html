    <p>Millenial looking for hot job opportunities. My name is Felix Ruano and I'm 19 years old, I currently live in Merida, Yucatan and this is my portfolio. I was born in Cozumel, Quintana Roo and raised in 7 different states, some of the places where I lived appart from Cozumel are: Mexico City, Puebla, Xalapa, Puerto Vallarta and Merida. I've spent most of my life in Merida and I'm absolutely in love with the city. I had the great opportunity to live in so many different places because of my dad's job, he's been working in the hotel industry for quite some time and we've always been on the move. After many years of constant moving we decided that Merida has been our favorite place by far.</p> <br>
    <p>Some interesting info about me is that I'm currently going through some rough times with my family but I've learned to live with it, I consider myself a hiphop head and I have a deep pasion for video games. Hopefully I will be able to make one someday in the future. I dropped out of college a couple of months ago because of personal reasons, since then I've been on the look out for a coding bootcamp or online courses to keep learning about programming. I studied one semester of CS at Anahuc Mayab here in Merida but I decided that college wasn't for me, luckily I found this Bootcamp and it has been an amazing experience so far. I will be posting some projects in this portfolio, hope you all like it.</p>
